# Sq0xx

Squat b0xx.

I've printed and tested V1, there are some fixes in the V2 case files that are untested but should work just fine.

The PCB has had some fixes but not many.

## BOM
* 3D printed, Top, Top logo, plate, bottom and 20 key caps.
* PCB, I suggest JLCPCB
* 20 MX keyboard switches
* 20 kailh hot swap sockets
* Raspberry pico micro controller.

## Firmware
